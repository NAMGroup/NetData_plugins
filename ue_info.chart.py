In order to talk with the amarifost gNodeB we set the following parameters:
prot: is ws (should not be changed)
ip: should be the IP of the gNodeB we wish to talk to (This could be moved into a conf file)
gnb_port: Default value (9001) should be OK. Change as required if the GnodeB conf has changed

In this plugin we send try to visualize data from the result of ue_get command.
'''
msg_to_send="{\"message\":\"ue_get\",\"stats\":true}"


'''
Every command returns a lot of information.
Each entry in this dictionary is in the form of: {chart_key:[metric1. metric2, ...metricN]}
This means that the chart keyed chart_key will have n metrics (lines/dimensions in it)
Each chartkey/chart metrics values are selected depending on the data that are returned through the web socket and the infor we want to visualize.
By addinf more rows or by commenting existing rows in this dictionary we can modify the displayed charts.
In this plugin we have decided to display the following charts.

'''
charts_to_create= {
       "bitrate":["dl_bitrate", "ul_bitrate" ] ,
       "tx": ["dl_tx", "ul_tx"],
       "retx":["dl_retx", "ul_retx"],
       "snr":["pucch1_snr","pusch_snr"]
}



'''
In order to define a chart the following info is required for the visualization part:
TITLE:  The chart title (to differentiate between other charts of the same plugin)
units:  The units of the chart. In our plugin we also use the units as the label in the y-axis
legend: The various lines shown in this chart.
